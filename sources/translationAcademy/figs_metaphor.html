<h3 class="sectionedit2" id="description">Description</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
A metaphor occurs when someone speaks of something as if it were something else because there is something that they have in common. That is, in some way one is like the other. The thing he speaks of is called the <strong>topic</strong>.  The thing he calls it is the <strong>image</strong>. The way that they are similar is the <strong>point of comparison</strong>.
</p>

<p>
1. Sometimes the <strong>topic</strong> and the <strong>image</strong> are both stated clearly. 
</p>
<blockquote><div class="no">
Jesus said to them. “<em class="u">I am the bread of life</em>. He who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes on me will never thirst.“ (John 6:35 ULB)</div></blockquote>

<p>
Jesus called himself the bread of life. The topic is “I” and the image is “bread.” Bread is a food that people ate all the time. The point of comparison is that both are necessary to have life. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.
</p>

<p>
2. Sometimes only the <strong>image</strong> is stated clearly.
</p>
<blockquote><div class="no">
Produce <em class="u">fruits</em> that are worthy of repentance (Luke 3:8)</div></blockquote>

<p>
The image here is “fruits.” The topic is not stated, but the reader must understand that it is actions or behavior. Just as trees can produce good fruit or bad fruit, people can produce good behavior or bad behavior. The point of comparison is that both behavior and fruit reveal the nature of their source. Fruits that are worthy of repentance are good behavior that is appropriate for people who have repented.
</p>

<p>
3. The <strong>point of comparison</strong> is usually not stated clearly. It is up to the reader to think about the topic and the image and to ponder how the two things are similar. It is important to remember that in any one metaphor there is only one point of comparison. The topic and the image are usually very different things that are not similar in most ways. But the person making the metaphor wants the hearer or reader to think about the one way that they are similar.

<div class="level4">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> One purpose of metaphor is to teach people about something that they do not know (the <strong>topic</strong>) by showing that it is like something that they already know (the <strong>image</strong>).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Another purpose  is to emphasize that something has a particular quality or to show that it has that quality in an extreme way.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Another purpose is to lead people to feel the same way about one thing as they would feel toward another.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Often metaphors are the favorite way for speakers of a language to talk about something. For example, when English speakers talk about the amount of something changing, they often say that it is going up or down. (“The literacy rate is going up.” “The price of bread has gone down.”) Many other languages require their speakers to say these things in other ways.</div>

<blockquote><div class="no">
<em class="u">I am the good shepherd</em>. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. (John 10:11 ULB)</div></blockquote>

<p>
In the metaphor above, the topic is “I” and the image is “the good shepherd.” Jesus called himself the good shepherd. Jesus then helps the reader understand the metaphor by saying in what way the shepherd is good. A good shepherd saves the lives of his sheep even if it would put his own life in danger. In the same way, Jesus wanted to save his people and would die in order to do it.
</p>
<blockquote><div class="no">
Jesus said to them, “Take heed and beware of <em class="u">the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees</em>.” The disciples reasoned among themselves and said, “It is because we took no bread.” (Matthew 16:6-7 ULB)</div></blockquote>

<p>
Jesus used a metaphor, but his disciples did not realize it. When he said “yeast,” they thought he was talking about bread, but “yeast” was the image in his metaphor, and the topic that he did not state was the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Since the disciples did not understand what Jesus meant, it would not be good to state clearly here what Jesus meant. The meaning of the metaphor is made clear in verse 12.

1. If the target audience would not realize that the phrase has a metaphor, then change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding “like” or “as.”

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against a pointed stick.”</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
3. Or, if the target audience would not know the <strong>image</strong>,  or if the image is not used in the same way, use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> <strong>his hand was leprous, as white as <em class="u">snow</em>.</strong> (Exodus 4:6) - If people would not know what snow is, you could choose something else that is very white.</div>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
4. Or, if the target audience would not know the <strong>image</strong>, simply state the truth that the metaphor was used to communicate.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> <strong>I will make you become <em class="u">fishers</em> of men.</strong> Mark 1:17</div>

<p>
5. If the target audience would not know what the <strong>topic</strong> is, then state the topic clearly. (However, do not do this if the original audience did not know what the topic was.)
</p>

<p>
6. If the target audience would not know <strong>the point of comparison</strong>, then state clearly how the topic is like the image.

<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> <strong>I am the light of the world.</strong> (John 9:5 ULB)</div>

<p>
7. If the metaphor seems to be a normal way to say something in the the biblical language, then use the normal way that your language says that same thing.
