====== Luke 11 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament, poems or special prayers. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 11:2-4, which is a special prayer, commonly called the "Lord's Prayer." This prayer in Matthew 6 also has the phrase, "but deliver us from the evil one."

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The Lord's Prayer ==

This is not a prayer to be recited over and over again, although this prayer can be used in that way. Instead, it provides a model for how Christians are to pray.

== Jonah ==
Jonah was an Old Testament prophet of some significance but not a great deal of significance. He called for a Gentile nation to repent of their sins and they obeyed. These events cause the Jewish prophet to be upset with God's grace being shown to Gentiles. This chapter finds a parallel with the future attitude of the Jews, their lack of repentance and eventually becoming upset with God for the grace he shows to the gentiles. 

== Light ==
Light is a common image in Scripture used to represent [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]]. Light is also used to show the path of righteousness and to show righteous living. Darkness is often used as an image to represent [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] or [[:en:obe:kt:unrighteous|unrighteousness]].

== Washing ==
This was a practice done by the Pharisees, but it was not an obligation according to the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Moses]]. The Pharisees had many rituals involving washing in an attempt to make themselves [[:en:obe:kt:clean]]. This is [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony|ironic]] because no amount of water could make them spiritually clean.
