\v 39 The Lord Jesus said to Him, "You Pharisees wash the outside of cups and dishes before you eat, but within yourselves you are very greedy and wicked.
\v 40 You foolish people! Surely you know that God not only made the outside, but he also made the inside!
\v 41 Instead of worrying about dishes being ritually clean, be merciful and give whatever is inside the dishes to those in need, and then both the inside and outside of you will be clean.

<usfm>
\v 39 But the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of cups and bowls, but the inside of you is filled with greed and evil.
\v 40 You senseless men! Did not the one who made the outside also make the inside?
\v 41 Give to the poor what is inside, and then all things will be clean for you.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus begins to speak to the Pharisee.

  * **the outside of cups and bowls** - Washing of the outside of containers was a part of the ritual practices of the Pharisees. 
  * **but the inside of you is filled with greed and evil** - This compares the way they ignore the inside of the container to how they ignore their own internal condition. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Did not the one who made the outside also make the inside?** - Jesus uses a question to rebuke the Pharisees for not understanding that what is in their hearts matters to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Give to the poor what is inside** - AT: "Give to the poor what is inside you cups and bowls" or "Be generous to the poor"
