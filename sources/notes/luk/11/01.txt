  * **It happened** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **when he finished praying** - "when Jesus finished praying." It may be more natural to state that Jesus was praying before saying "when he finished praying."
