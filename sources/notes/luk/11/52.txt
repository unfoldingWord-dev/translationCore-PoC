===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes responding to the Jewish teacher.

  * **you have taken away the key of knowledge...hinder those who are entering** - Jesus speaks about God's truth as if it were in a house that the teachers refuse to enter and will not let other enter either. This means the teachers do not truly know God, and they prevent others from knowing him as well. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the key** - This represents the means of access, as to a house or storage room.
  * **you do not enter in yourselves** - "you yourselves do not go in to get knowledge"
