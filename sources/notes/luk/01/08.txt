  * **the customary way** - "the traditional method" or "their usual way"
  * **chosen by lot** - A lot was a marked stone that was thrown or rolled on the ground in order to help them decide something. The priests believed that God guided the lot to show them which priest he wanted them to choose. (See: [[:en:ta:customs:religious:bylot]])
  * **so he might burn incense** - The priests were to burn sweet-smelling incense as an offering to God each morning and evening on a special altar inside the temple.
