===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For** - "Because" or "In addition to this"
  * **joy and gladness** - These two words mean the same thing and could be combined if your language does not have similar terms. AT: "very glad." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **at his birth** - "because of his birth"
  * **he will be great in the sight of the Lord** - "he will be a very important person for the Lord" or "God will consider him to be very important" (UDB)
  * **he will be filled with the Holy Spirit** - This could be stated as an active phrase: AT: "the Holy Spirit will empower him" or "the Holy Spirit will guide him." Make sure it does not sound similar to what an evil spirit might do to a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from his mother's womb** - People had been filled with the Holy Spirit before, but no one had heard of an unborn baby being filled with the Holy Spirit.
