===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - While Zechariah does his duty in the temple, an angel comes from God to give him a message.

  * **Now** - This word marks the beginning of the action in the story.
  * **appeared to him** - "suddenly came to him" or "was suddenly there with Zechariah." This expresses that the angel was present with Zechariah, and not simply a vision.
  * **Zechariah was terrified...fear fell on him** - These two phrases mean the same thing, and emphasize how afraid Zechariah was.
  * **when he saw him** - "when he saw the angel." The source of the fear was the frightening nature of the angel. Zechariah had not done anything wrong.
  * **fear fell on him** - Fear is described as something that attacked or overpowered Zechariah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do not be afraid** - "Stop being afraid of me" or "You do not need to be afraid of me."
  * **your prayer has been heard** - "God has heard what you asked." The following is implied and could be added: "and will grant it." God did not just hear what Zechariah prayed for; he was also going to do it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **bear you a son** - "have a son for you" or "give birth to your son"
