===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **How will this happen** - AT: "How is this possible?" Though Mary did not understand how it could happen, she did not doubt that it would happen.
  * **I have not slept with any man** - Mary used this polite expression to say that she had not engaged in sexual activity. AT: "I am a virgin." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **The Holy Spirit will come upon you** - The process of Mary's conception would begin with the Holy Spirit coming to her.
  * **will come upon** - "will overtake" or "will happen to"
  * **the power of the Most High** - It was God's "power" that would supernaturally cause Mary to become pregnant even while she still remained a virgin. Make sure this does not imply any physical or sexual unionâ€”this was a miracle. 
  * **will come over you** - "will cover you like a shadow"
  * **the holy one** - AT: "the holy child" or "the holy baby"
  * **will be called** - Possible meanings are 1) "people will call him" or 2) "God will call him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God** - Even though Jesus' mother Mary was a human, God supernaturally placed Jesus within her as a child. Therefore, God was his father, and Jesus was called the "Son of God."
  * **Son of God** - This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
