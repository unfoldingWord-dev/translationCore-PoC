\v 1-2 My noble \add friend\add* Theophilus, many people saw the things that \add Jesus\add* did while he was with us, from the time when he started \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add his ministry\add*. They served God \add by teaching people\add* the message\add about the Lord Jesus\add*. Many of those who heard what they taught wrote down for us accounts of the things that \add Jesus did from the time when\add* he began\add his ministry\add*.
\v 3 I myself have studied carefully these accounts. So I decided that it would be good for me also to write for you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* an accurate account of these matters.

\v 1 Dear Theophilus, 
\p Many people have written reports about the amazing events that have happened among us.
\v 2 We heard about these things from people who saw them happen, from the time everything first started happening. These people taught others about God's message.
\v 3 I myself have carefully studied everything that these people wrote and taught. So I decided that it would also be good for me to write for you, noble Theophilus, an accurate account of these matters.
\v 4 I am doing this so that you may know that what you have been taught about these things is true.

\p 
\v 1 Many have tried to set in order a narrative about those matters that have been fulfilled among us,   
\v 2 just as they handed them to us, who from the beginning have been eyewitnesses and servants of the message. 
\v 3 So to me also, having accurately investigated the course of all these things from the start—it seemed good to me to write them down in their order—most excellent Theophilus. 
\v 4 This is so that you might know the truth about the things that you were taught.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Luke explains why he writes to Theophilus.

  * **matters** - "reports" or "true stories"
  * **among us** - The word "us" in this phrase may or may not exclude Theophilus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **handed them to us** - The "us" in this phrase does not include Theophilus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **handed them** - "gave them" or "delivered them"
  * **servants of the message** - You may need to specify what the message is. AT: "had served God by telling people his message" or "had taught people the good news about Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **accurately investigated** - "carefully researched." Luke was careful to find out exactly what happened. He probably talked to the different people who saw what happened to make sure that what he wrote down about these events was correct. 
  * **most excellent Theophilus** - Luke said this to show honor and respect for Theophilus. This may mean that Theophilus was an important government official. This section should use the style that your culture uses to address people of high status. Some people may prefer to also put this greeting at the beginning and say, "To...Theophilus" or "Dear...Theophilus."
  * **most excellent** - "honorable" or "noble" 
  * **Theophilus** - This name means "friend of God." It may describe this man's character or it may have been his actual name. Most translations have it as a name. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])
