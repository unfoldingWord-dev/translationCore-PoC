===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The UDB rearranges these verses into a verse bridge in order to keep the information about Israel together. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

  * **He has given help to** - "The Lord has helped" 
  * **Israel his servant** - If readers confuse this with the the man named Israel, it could be translated as "his servant, the nation of Israel" or "Israel, his servants." 
  * **so as to** - "in order to"
  * **to remember** - God cannot forget. When God "remembers," it is an idiom that means God acts upon his earlier promise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **as he said to our fathers** - "just as he promised our ancestors he would do." This phrase supplies background information about God's promise to Abraham. AT: "because he promised our ancestors he would be merciful." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **his descendants** - "Abraham's descendants"
