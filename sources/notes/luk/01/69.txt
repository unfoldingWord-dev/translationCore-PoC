===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **a horn of salvation for us** - The horn of an animal is a symbol for its power to defend itself. This meaning could be stated clearly. AT: "someone with the power to save us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the house of...from among the descendants of** - These two phrases refer to the same thing, and emphasize that one who will save them is a direct descendant from King David. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **in the house of** - "within the family of"
  * **from among the descendants** - "one of the descendants"
  * **as he spoke** - "just as God said"
  * **spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets** - God enabled the prophets to speak the words he wanted them to speak. God's control can the stated. AT: "caused his holy prophets to say." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **by the mouth of** - This idiom means "my means of" or "through the voices of." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **were in ancient times** - "lived long ago"
  * **bring salvation** - This here refers to physical rescue, rather than to spiritual salvation.
  * **our enemies...all who hate us** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how strongly their enemies are against them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **from the hand of** - It may be helpful to restate "salvation" here. AT: "salvation from the hand of." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **hand** - "power" or "control." The word "hand" is associated with the power or control that is being used to harm God's people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
