===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **to show mercy to** - "to be merciful to" or "to act according to his mercy toward"
  * **remember** - Here the word "remember" means to keep a commitment or fulfill something.
  * **his holy covenant...the oath that he spoke** - These two phrases refer to the same thing. They are repeated to show the seriousness of God's promise to Abraham. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **to grant to us** - "to make it possible for us"
  * **that we, having been delivered...would serve him without fear** - It may be helpful to change the order of these phrases. AT: "that we would serve him without fear after we are rescued from the power of our enemies."
  * **out of the hand of our enemies** - "hand" refers to the control or power a person. This could be stated clearly. AT: "from the control of our enemies." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **without fear** - This refers back to the fear of their enemies. This could be stated. AT: "without being afraid of our enemies." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
