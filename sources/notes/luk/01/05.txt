===== Translation Notes: =====

Zechariah and Elizabeth find out they will have a child.

  * **In the days of Herod, king of Judea** - AT: "During the time that King Herod ruled over Judea"
  * **Judea** - AT: "the region of Judea" or "the people who lived in Judea"
  * **there was a certain** - "there was a particular" or "there was a." This is a way of introducing a new character in a story. Consider how your language does this. 
  * **division** - AT: "division of priests" or "group of priests."
  * **of Abijah** - "who descended from Abijah." Abijah was an ancestor of this group of priests and all of them were descended from Aaron, who was the first Israelite priest.
  * **His wife** - "Zechariah's wife"
  * **was from the daughters of Aaron** - "was descended from Aaron" or AT: "Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth were both descended from Aaron."
  * **before God** - "in God's sight" or "in God's opinion"
  * **walking** - "obeying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all the commandments and requirements of the Lord**  - AT: "all that the Lord had commanded and required"
  * **But** - This contrast word shows that what follows here is the opposite of what is expected. People expected that if they did what was right, God would allow them to have children. Although this couple did what was right, they did not have any children.
