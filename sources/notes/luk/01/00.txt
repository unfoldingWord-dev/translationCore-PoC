====== Luke 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart long prayers or prophesies. For this reason, the ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:46-55, 68-79.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "He will be called John" ==
It was unusual in the ancient Near East to use a name for a child that wasn't the name of a relative. Since Elizabeth and Zechariah did not have a person named "John" in their family. This name was very surprising to people.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

Luke does not use a lot of complex wording. His language is simple and straightforward.
