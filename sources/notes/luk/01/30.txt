===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Do not be afraid, Mary** - The angel does not want Mary to be afraid of his appearance, because God sent him with a positive message. 
  * **you have found favor with God** - The idiom "to find favor" means to be positively received by someone. The sentence can be altered to show God as the actor. AT: "God has decided to give you his grace" or "God is showing you his kindness."
  * **you will conceive in your womb and bear a son...Jesus...the Son of the Most High** - Mary will bear "a son" who will be called "the Son of the Most High" (UDB). Jesus is therefore a human son born of a human mother, and he is also the Son of God. These terms should be translated very carefully.
  * **will be called** - Possible meanings are 1) "people will call him" or 2) "God will call him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Son of the Most High** - This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **give him the throne of his ancestor David** - The throne represents the king's authority to rule. AT: "give him authority to rule as king as his ancestor David did." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **there will be no end to his kingdom** - The negative phrase "no end" emphasizes that it continues forever. It could also be stated with a positive phrase. AT: "his kingdom will never end." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
