===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 People who faithfully manage only small amounts of money, can also be trusted with much more. People who are dishonest in the way they handle unimportant duties will be dishonest in the way they handle important matters.
\v 11 You have money in your care that was made dishonestly, but if you have not been honest in the way you have managed that money, no one will give you property of your own.
\v 12 You have been managing other people's money, but if you were dishonest you should not expect anyone to give you money you could invest for yourself.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 He who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much, and he who is unrighteous in very little is also unrighteous in much.
\v 11 If you have not been faithful in using unrighteous money, who will trust you with true wealth?
\v 12 And if you have not been faithful in using other people's money, who will give you money of your own?
