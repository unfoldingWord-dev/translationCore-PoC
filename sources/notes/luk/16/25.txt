\v 26 Besides that, there is a huge ravine between you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* and us. So those who want to go from here to where you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are, are not able to. Furthermore, no one can cross from there to where we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are.'

\v 25 But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things. But now he is comforted here, and you are in agony.
\v 26 And besides all this, a great chasm has been firmly placed, so that those who want to cross over from here to you will not be able to, and no one will be able to come across from there to us.'
