===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - As Jesus continues teaching the people he begins to tell a story. It is about a rich man and Lazarus.
  * **General Information:** - These verses give background information about the story Jesus begins to tell about the rich man and Lazarus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **Now** - This marks a shift in Jesus' speech as he begins to tell a story that will help people understand what he was teaching them. 
  * **a certain rich man** - This phrase introduces a person in Jesus' story. It is not clear if this was a real person, or simply a story that Jesus told in order to make a point. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **who was clothed in purple and fine linen** - "who wore clothing made with fine linen and purple dye" or "who wore very expensive clothes." Purple dye and fine linen cloth were very expensive. 
  * **was enjoying every day his great wealth** - AT: "enjoyed eating expensive food every day" or "spent much money and bought whatever he desired"
  * **A certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate** - AT: "people had laid a certain beggar named Lazarus at his gate" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **A certain beggar named Lazarus** - This phrase introduces another person in Jesus' story. It is not clear if this was a real person, or simply a story that Jesus told in order to make a point. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **at his gate** - "at the gate to the rich man's house" or "at the entrance to the rich man's property"
  * **covered with sores** - "with sores all over his body" 
  * **he yearned to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table** - AT: "he wished for the rich man to give him his extra food that he threw away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **besides that** - This shows that what follows is even worse than what has already be told about Lazarus. AT: "in addition to that" or "even." 
  * **dogs** - Dogs were an unclean animal. Lazarus was too sick and weak to stop the dogs from licking his wounds.
