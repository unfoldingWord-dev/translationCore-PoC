====== Luke 16 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Abraham's side" ==
Abraham's side, in Luke [[:en:bible:notes:luk:16:22|16:22]], is also known as Abraham's bosom. Many people view this as a place where the righteous dead went when they died. This is because their [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sins]] were only covered until they were eventually paid for by the death of Christ.

== Jesus' teaching about divorce ==

In this chapter, Jesus teaches about divorce as a response to a challenge from Pharisees. Jesus bases his teaching on God's original intentions in creating marriage. Jesus implicitly shows the mistakes that the religious leaders made in their traditions about marriage.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Allusion ==
Abraham is recorded as saying "neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead." This is a allusion to the fact that Jesus will soon rise from the dead and they will not be persuaded by this fact.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "The law and the prophets were in effect until John came" ==
The phase does not mean the regulations of the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]] ended during the time of John the Baptist. It is clear from the gospels, that Jesus lived and ministered under the law. What has changed is the message being proclaimed. This is why the UDB states, "The laws that God gave Moses and what the prophets wrote were proclaimed until John the Baptizer came." (See: [[:en:bible:notes:luk:16:16|16:16]])
