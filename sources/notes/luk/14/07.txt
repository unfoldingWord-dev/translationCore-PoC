\v 7 Jesus noticed that the people who had been invited to the meal were  choosing to sit in the places where important people usually sit. Then he gave this advice to them:
\v 8 "When one of you is invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit in a place where important people sit. It may be that a man more important than you has also been invited to the feast.
\v 9 When that man comes, the man who invited both of you will come say to you, 'Let this man take your seat!' Then you will have to take the least important seat, and you will be ashamed.

\p
\v 7 When Jesus noticed how those who were invited chose the seats of honor, he spoke a parable, saying to them,
\v 8 "When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the place of honor, because someone may have been invited who is more honored than you.
\v 9 When the person who invited both of you arrives, he will say to you, 'Give this other person your place,' and then in shame you will proceed to take the lowest place.
