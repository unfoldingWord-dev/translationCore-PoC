\v 34 Jesus also said, "You are like salt, which is very useful. But if salt were to lose its saltiness, could it ever be made to taste salty again?
\v 35 If salt does not taste salty anymore, it is no longer any good even for the soil or manure heap. People just throw it away. Every one of you should listen carefully to what I am telling you!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 34 Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again?
\v 35 It is of no use for the soil or even for the manure pile. It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
