  * [[:en:obe:other:obey]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **General Information:** - There is a brief break in Jesus' teachings as the disciples speak to him. Then Jesus continues teaching.

  * **Increase our faith** - "Please give us more faith" or "Please add more faith to our faith"
  * **If you had faith as a mustard seed** - A "mustard seed" is a very small seed. Jesus implies that they did not have even a small amount of faith. AT: "If you had faith that was even as small as mustard seed" or "If only your faith was as big as a mustard seed, but it isn't." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **this sycamore tree** - AT: "a fig tree" or "a tree"
  * **Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea** - AT: "Uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea" or "Take your roots out of the ground, and put your roots down into the ocean" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **it would obey you** - "the tree would obey you." This result is conditional. It would happen only if they had faith.
