\v 21 At that very time Jesus was healing many people of their diseases and \add other\add* sicknesses, he was \add casting out\add* evil spirits, and he was causing many blind people to be able to see.
\v 22 So he answered those two men, "Go back and report to John what you have seen \add me doing\add* and what you have heard \add me telling people. I am enabling\add* blind people to see. \add I am enabling\add* lame people to walk. \add I am\add* healing people who have leprosy. \add I am enabling\add* deaf people to hear. \add I am causing\add* dead people to become alive again, \add and I am\add* telling \add God's\add* good message to poor people.
\v 23 \add Also tell John that God\add* is pleased with those who do not stop believing in me \add because what I do is not what they expect the Messiah to do\add*."

\v 21 At that same time Jesus was healing many people from sicknesses and serious diseases, and from  evil spirits. He also healed many blind people so that they were able to see.
\v 22 So he answered those two men, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: People who were blind are now seeing. People who were lame are now walking. People who had skin diseases are being healed. People who were deaf can now hear. People who were dead are being made to live again and good news is being proclaimed to the poor.
\v 23 And also tell him, "God will bless anyone who sees what I do and hears what I teach and does not turn away from me."

\v 21 In that hour he cured many people from sicknesses and afflictions and from evil spirits, and to many blind people he gave sight.
\v 22 Jesus answered and said to them, "After you have gone on your way, report to John what you have seen and heard.  Blind people are receiving sight, lame people are walking, lepers are being cleansed, deaf people are hearing, dead people are being raised back to life, and needy people are being told the good news.
\v 23 The person who does not stop believing in me because of my actions is blessed."
