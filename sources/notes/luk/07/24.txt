\v 24 When the men whom John had sent left, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said to them, "\add Think about\add* what sort of person you went to see in the desolate area \add when you went there to see John\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. \add You did not go there to listen to a man who constantly changed the nature of his message\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like\add* a reed that is blown back and forth by the wind \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\v 25 Then what kind of man did you go there to see \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? Was he \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a man who wore expensive clothes? No! \add You know very well that\add* people who wear beautiful clothes and live in luxury are in kings' palaces, \add not in the desolate areas\add*!
\v 26 Then what \add kind of person\add* did you go to see? \add Did you\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add go there to see John because he was\add* a prophet? Yes! But I will tell you that \add John is\add* more \add important\add* than an \add ordinary\add* prophet.

\v 24 When the men whom John had sent left, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said, "What did you go into the wilderness to see? A thin stalk of a plant shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see? A man in fancy clothing? Look, those who wear splendid clothes and who have the best of everything live in kings' palaces.
\v 26 Then what did you go out there to see? A prophet? Yes! But I tell you that John is more important than an ordinary prophet.

\v 24 After John's messengers had gone away, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the desert to see, a reed being shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see, a man dressed in soft clothes? See, people who dress in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' palaces.

\v 26 But what did you go out to see, a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to speak to the crowd about John the Baptist.
  * **What...a reed being shaken by the wind?** - This expects a negative answer. "Did you go out to see a reed shaken by the wind? Of course not!" It can also be written as a statement. AT: "Surely you did not go out to see a reed being shaken by the wind!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **a reed being shaken by the wind** - Possible meanings of this metaphor are 1) a person who easily changes his mind, as reeds are easily moved by the wind, or 2) a person who talks a lot but does not say anything important, as reeds rattle when the wind blows. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **But what...a man dressed in soft clothes?** - This also expects a negative answer, since John wore rough garments. "Did you go out to see a man dressed in soft clothes? Of course not!" This could also be written as a statement. AT: You certainly did not go out to see a man dressed in soft clothes!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **dressed in soft clothes** - AT: "wearing expensive clothing" 
  * **kings' palaces** - A palace is a large, expensive house that a king lives in.
  * **But what...a prophet?** - This leads to a positive answer. "Did you go out to see a prophet? Of course you did!" This could also be written as a statement. AT: "But you actually went out to see a prophet!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Yes, I say to you** - Jesus said this to emphasize the importance of what he would say next.
  * **much more than a prophet** - This phrase means that John was indeed a prophet, but that he was even greater than a typical prophet. AT: "not just an ordinary prophet" or "much more important than a normal prophet."
