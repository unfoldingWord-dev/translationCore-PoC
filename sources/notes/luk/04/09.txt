\v 9 Then the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem. He set him on the highest part of the temple and said to him, " If you really are the Son of God, jump down from here.
\v 10 You will not be hurt, because it is written in the scriptures, 
\q1 'God will command his angels to protect you.'
\v 11 And it also says, 
\q1 'They will lift you up in their hands when you are falling, so that you will not get hurt. You will not even strike your foot on a stone.'"

\v 9 Next the devil led Jesus to Jerusalem and put him on the very highest point of the temple building, and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here. 
\v 10 For it is written,  
\q1 'He will command his angels to take care of you, to protect you,' 
\q1 \v 11 and, 'They will lift you up in their hands,
\q1 so that you will not hit your foot against a stone'."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the very highest point** - This was the corner of the temple roof. If someone fell from there, they would be seriously injured or die.
  * **If you are the Son of God** - The devil was challenging Jesus to prove that he was the Son of God.
  * **Son of God** - This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **throw yourself down** - "jump down to the ground"
  * **For it is written** - The devil implies that his quote from the Psalms means Jesus will not be hurt if he is the Son of God. This could be stated clearly, as the UDB does: AT: "You will not be hurt, because it is written" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **it is written** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Psalmist has written." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **He will command** - "He" refers to God. The devil partially quoted from the Psalms in an effort to persuade Jesus to jump off the building.
