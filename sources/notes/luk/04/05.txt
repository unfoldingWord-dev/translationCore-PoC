\v 5 Then the devil led him up to a high place, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
\v 6 The devil said to him, "I will give to you the authority to rule all of these kingdoms, along with all their splendor. I can do this because they have been given to me to rule over, and I can give them to anyone I want to. 
\v 7 Therefore if you will bow down before me and worship me, all of this will be yours."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **a high place** - "a high mountain"
  * **in a moment of time** - "in an instant" or "instantly"
  * **they have been given to me to rule over** - Since God is the only one who could give this authority to the devil, this could be stated in active form. AT: "God has permitted me to control them all" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Therefore** - "So"
  * **if you will bow down before me...worship me** - These two phrases are very similar. They could be combined. AT: "if you will bow down in worship to me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **all of this will be yours** - "I will give all these kingdoms to you"
