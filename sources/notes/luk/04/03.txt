===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If you are the Son of God** - The devil challenges Jesus to do this miracle in order to prove that he is "the Son of God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **this stone** - The devil either holds a stone in his hand or points to a nearby stone.
  * **Jesus answered him** - Jesus' rejection of the devil's challenge is clearly implied in his answer. It may be helpful to state this clearly for your audience, as the UDB does: "Jesus replied, 'No, I will not do that.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **It is written** - The quotation is from Moses' writings in the Old Testament. This could be stated in active form. AT: "Moses has written in the scriptures." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Man shall not live on bread alone** - The word "bread" refers to food in general. Food as compared to God, by itself, is not enough to sustain a person. Jesus quotes the scripture to say why he would not turn the stone into bread. AT: "People cannot live on just bread" or "It is not just food that makes a person live." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
