====== Luke 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 4:10-11, 18-19, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "(Jesus) was tempted there by the devil" ==
In translation, it is important not to imply that Jesus actually considered or was in fact "tempted" by the devil. It is more accurate (theologically) to say that the devil "tried to tempt" Jesus.
