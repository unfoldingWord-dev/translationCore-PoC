\v 6-7 When they arrived in Bethlehem, there was no place for them to stay in a place where visitors usually stayed. So they had to stay in a place where animals slept overnight. While they were there the time came for Mary to give birth and she gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him in wide strips of cloth and placed him in the feeding place for the animals.

\v 6 Now it came about that while they were there, the time came for her to deliver her baby.  
\v 7 She gave birth to a son, her firstborn child, and she wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth. Then she put him in an animal feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This tells of the birth of Jesus and the announcement by the angels to the shepherds.
  * **General Information:** - The UDB rearranges these verses into a verse bridge in order to keep together the details about the place they stayed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

  * **Now it came about** - This phrase marks the beginning of the next event in the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **while they were there** - "while Mary and Joseph were in Bethlehem"
  * **the time came for her to deliver her baby** - "it was time to give birth to her baby"
  * **wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth** - This was the normal way that mothers protected and cared for their babies in that culture. You could state this clearly. AT: "wrapped a warm blanket firmly around him" or "wrapped him comfortably in a blanket." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **an animal feeding trough** - This was some kind of box or frame that people put hay or other food in for animals to eat. It was most likely clean and may have had something soft and dry like hay in it as a cushion for the baby. Animals were often kept near the home to keep them secure and to feed them easily. Apparently Mary and Joseph stayed in a room that was used for animals.
  * **there was no room for them in the inn** - "there was no space for them to stay in the guest room." This was probably because so many people went to Bethlehem to register. Luke adds this as background information. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
