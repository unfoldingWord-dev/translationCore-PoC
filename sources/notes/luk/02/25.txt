===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - When Mary and Joseph are at the temple, they meet two people: Simeon, who praises God and gives a prophecy about the child, and the prophetess Anna.

  * **Behold** - The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **was righteous and devout** - These abstract terms can be expressed as actions. AT: "did what was pleasing to God and obeyed God's laws." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **comforter of Israel** - It is another name for the "Messiah" or "Christ." AT: "the one who would comfort Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the Holy Spirit was upon him** - "the Holy Spirit was with him." God was with him in a special way and gave him wisdom and direction in his life. 
  * **It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Holy Spirit had shown him" or "The Holy Spirit had told him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
