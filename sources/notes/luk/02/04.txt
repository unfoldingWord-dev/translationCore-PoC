===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The UDB rearranges these two verses into a verse bridge in order to make it easier to shorten the sentences. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

  * **Joseph also** - This introduces Joseph as a new participant in the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **the city of Nazareth in Galilee** - "the city of Nazareth in the region of Galilee"
  * **which is known as the city of David** - This is background information about the importance of Bethlehem. Although it was a small town, King David was born there, and there was a prophecy that the Messiah would be born there. AT: "city of King David." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **because he was a descendant** - "because Joseph was a descendant"
  * **to register** - This means to report to the officials there so they could include him in the count. Use a term for an official government count if possible.
  * **along with Mary** - Mary traveled with Joseph from Nazareth. It is likely that women were also taxed, so Mary would have needed to travel and be registered as well. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **who was engaged to him** - "his fiancee" or "who was promised to him." An engaged couple was considered legally married, but there would not have been physical intimacy between them.
