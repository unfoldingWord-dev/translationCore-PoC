\v 1 At that time, some people told Jesus about some Galileans whom soldiers had recently killed in Jerusalem. Pilate, the Roman governor, had ordered soldiers to kill them while they were offering sacrifices in the temple.
\v 2 Jesus replied to them, "Do you think that this happened to those people from Galilee because they were more sinful than all the other Galileans?
\v 3 I assure you, that was not the reason! But you need to remember that God will similarly punish you if you do not turn from your sinful behavior.

\v 1 At that time, some people there told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate mixed with their own sacrifices.
\v 2 Jesus answered and said to them, "Do you think that these Galileans were more sinful than all the other Galileans because they suffered in this way?  
\v 3 No, I tell you. But if you do not repent, all of you will perish in the same way.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus is still speaking in front of the crowd. This is the same part of the story that begin in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:12:01|12:1]]. 
  * **General Information:** - In these verses, some people in the crowd ask Jesus a question and he begins to respond.

  * **At that time** - This phrase connects this event to the end of chapter 12 when Jesus was teaching a crowd of people.
  * **whose blood Pilate mixed with their own sacrifices** - Here "blood" refers to the death of the Galileans. Pilate probably ordered his soldiers to kill people rather than doing it himself. AT: "whom Pilate's soldiers killed while the Galileans were offering sacrifices." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Do you think that these Galileans were more sinful...way?** - "Were these Galileans more sinful...way?" or "Does this prove that these Galileans were more sinful...way?" Jesus uses a question to teach the people. AT: "You think that these Galileans were more sinful...way" or "Do not think that these Galileans were more sinful...way." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **No, I tell you** - Here "I tell you" emphasizes "no." AT: "They certainly were not more sinful" or "You are wrong to think that their suffering proves that they were more sinful."
  * **all of you will perish in the same way** - "all of you also will die." The phrase "in the same way" means they will experience the same result, not that they will die by the same method.
  * **perish** - "lose your life" or "die"
