===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the next part of the story. Jesus responds to a question by telling a parable about entering God's kingdom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **Jesus visited each town and village...and taught them** - This is background information that tell us what Jesus had been doing when this event occurred. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **are only a few people to be saved** - AT: "will God save only a few people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Struggle to enter through the narrow door** - "Work hard to go through the narrow doorway." Jesus is speaking about God's kingdom as if it were a house. Since Jesus is talking to a group, the "you" implied in this command is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **the narrow door** - Jesus represents entering the kingdom of God as entering a narrow door. The fact that the door is narrow implies that only a few people at a time can go through it. Translate it in a way to keep this restrictive meaning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
