====== Luke 13 General Notes ======

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Assumed Knowledge ==
This chapter begins with references to two events, whose stories have not been preserved ([[:en:bible:notes:luk:13:01|13:1-5]]). Despite this lack of knowledge, the teaching still makes sense to the modern reader. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== The use of paradox ==

This is a statement that seems absurd, that appears to contradict itself. A paradox occurs in this chapter: "the last are the first, and the first will be last" ([[:en:bible:notes:luk:13:28|13:30]]).
