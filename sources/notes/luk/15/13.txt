\v 13 Only a few days later, the younger son gathered together all that he owned and traveled to a country far away. There in that country he spent all his money foolishly in wasteful, immoral living.
\v 14 After he had spent all his money, there was a severe famine throughout that country. And soon he did not have anything left to live on.

<usfm>
\v 13 Not many days later, the younger son gathered together all he owned and went to a country far away, and there he wasted his money, buying things he did not need, and wasting his money on wild living.
\v 14 Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine spread throughout that country, and he began to be in need.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **gathered together all he owned** - "packed his things" or "put his things in his bag"
  * **buying things he did not need, and wasting his money on wild living** - AT: "by spending all his money on things he did not need"
  * **a severe famine spread throughout that country** - "a drought occurred there and the entire country did not have enough food"
  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Jesus explains how the younger son went from having plenty to being in need.
  * **to be in need** - "to lack what he needed" or "to not have enough"
