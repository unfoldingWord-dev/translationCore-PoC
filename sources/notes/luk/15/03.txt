\v 3 Jesus spoke this parable to them, saying,
\v 4 "Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep and then loses one of them, will not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the lost one until he finds it?
\v 5 Then when he has found it, he lays it across his shoulders and rejoices.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus begins to tell several parables. The first parable is about a man and his sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **to them** - Here "them" refers to the religious leaders.
  * **Which one of you...until he finds it?** - Jesus uses a question to remind the people that if any of them lost one of their sheep, they would certainly go looking for it. Some languages have ways of showing that this is a hypothetical situation and not a story about a particular person who has lost a sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep** - Since the parable starts with "Which one of you," some languages would continue the parable in the second person. AT: "Which one of you, if you have a hundred sheep." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **hundred...ninety-nine** - "100...99" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
