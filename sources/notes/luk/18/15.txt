\v 15 One day people were bringing even their babies to  Jesus so that he would put his hands on them and bless them. When the disciples saw this, they told them not to do that.
\v 16 But Jesus called for the children to  be brought to him. He said, "Let the little children come to me! Do not stop them! It is humble and trusting people like these children over whom God will agree to rule.
\v 17 Indeed I say to you that whoever does not accept with humility like a child for God to rule over them, he will not rule them at all."

\v 15 The people were also bringing to him their infants, so that he might touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
\v 16 But Jesus called them to him, saying, "Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them. For the kingdom of God belongs to such ones.
\v 17 Truly I say to you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of God like a child will definitely not enter it."

  * **touch them, but** - This could also be translated as separate sentences: "touch them. But."
  * **they rebuked them** - "the disciples tried to stop the parents from bringing their children to Jesus"
  * **Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them** - These two sentences have similar meaning and they are combined for emphasis. Some languages emphasize in a different way. AT: "You must certainly allow the children to come to me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **belongs to such ones** - AT: "belongs to people who are like these little children"
  * **Truly I say to you** - "Surely I say to you." Jesus used this expression to emphasize the importance of what he was about to say.
  * **whoever will not receive the kingdom of God like a child will definitely not enter it** - God requires people to accept his rule over them with trust and humility. AT: "whoever wants to enter God's kingdom must receive it with trust and humility like a child." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
