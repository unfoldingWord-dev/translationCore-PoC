====== Luke 18 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Luke 18:6-8 should be seen as an explanation of the parable in 18:1-5.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Unjust judge ==
Judges were supposed to administer justice without conditions, but this judge was not just to the woman. Instead, she had to beg many times for the judge to do the right thing. Therefore, the judge is referred to as "[[:en:obe:kt:unjust|unjust]]."

== Pharisees and tax collectors ==
Luke occasionally contrasts these two groups of people in his gospel. These two figures are the epitome of [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]] and [[:en:obe:kt:unrighteous|unrighteousness]] (according to the Pharisees). The Pharisees believed that they were very righteous and they believed that the tax collectors were very [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sinful]].

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Son of Man ==
Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man." Every language may not have the ability to have a person refer to himself in the third person.

== "Prayed these things about himself" ==
The Pharisee did not really "pray" because his prayer was not truly directed at God. His prayer was for himself and for other people to hear. 

== General and Specific Instructions ==

There are times that the New Testament gives specific instructions or commands that always applies to all Christians. At other times, its instructions are more general instructions and should only be taken as "good ideas." For example, "sell your possessions" is not meant to be instructive to all Christians.
