===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to tell a parable as he continues to teach his disciples. This is the same part of the story that begin in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:17:20|17:20]]. Verse 1 gives us a description of the parable Jesus is about to tell. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **Then he** - "Then Jesus"
  * **they should always pray, and not become discouraged** - These two clauses have similar meaning which Jesus used to emphasize his point. Some languages have different ways of emphasizing. AT: "always keep on praying." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **saying** - This could also begin a new sentence: "He said" (UDB).
  * **There was in a particular city, a judge** - The word "particular" is used as a way to say this happened, but without identifying the judge or the city.
  * **fear** - "revere" (UDB)
  * **did not respect people** - "paid no regard to a person"
