===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to his disciples.
  * **Then he** - "Then Jesus"
  * **saying** - This could also begin a new sentence: "He said" (UDB).
  * **they should always pray, and not become discouraged**  - These two clauses have similar meaning Jesus used to emphasize his point. Some languages have different ways of emphasizing. For example this could also be translated as "always keep on praying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **There was in a particular city, a judge**  - The word "particular" is used to as a way to say this this happened, but without identifying the judge or the city.
  * **fear**  - "revere" (UDB)
  * **did not respect people**  - "paid no regard to a person"
