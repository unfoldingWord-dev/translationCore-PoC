===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **him** - "Jesus"
  * **approaching him** - "coming close to Jesus"
  * **offering him vinegar** - "offering Jesus vinegar to drink." Vinegar is a cheap drink that common people drink. The soldiers were mocking Jesus by giving a cheap drink to someone who claims to be a king.
  * **a sign over him** - "a placard at the top of Jesus' cross that stated"
  * **THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS** - The people who put this sign above Jesus were mocking him. They did not really think he was a king.
