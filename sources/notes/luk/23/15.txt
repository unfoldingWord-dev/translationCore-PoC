<usfm>
\v 15 \add Obviously\add* Herod did not \add conclude that\add* either, because he sent him back to me \add without punishing him\add*. \add So it\add* is clear that this man has not done anything for which we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* should kill him.
\v 16-17 So I will \add have my soldiers\add* whip him and then release him."\f + Pilate had to release one prisoner for the people during the Passover festival each year."\f*
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Even Herod does not think he is guilty. I know this, because he sent him back to us without punishing him. So it is clear that this man does not deserve to die.
\v 16 So I will tell my soldiers to whip him and then set him free."
\v 17 (Pilate said this because he had to set free one prisoner at the Passover Celebration.)
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 No, nor does Herod, for he sent him back to us, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
\v 16 I will therefore punish him, and release him."
\v 17 \f + \ft The best ancient copies omit Luke 23:17, \fqa Now Pilate was obligated to release to the Jews one prisoner at the feast. \f*

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Pilate continues speaking to the Jewish leaders and to the crowd.

  * **No, nor does Herod** - AT: "Even Herod does not think he is guilty" (UDB) or "Even Herod thinks he is innocent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]]) 
  * **for** - "because" or "we know this because"
  * **he sent him back to us** - "Herod sent Jesus to return to us." The word "us" refers to Pilate and his soldiers, not to the priests and scribes who had gone to Herod with Jesus, nor to the crowd. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **nothing worthy of death has been done by him** - AT: "he has not done anything to deserve a death sentence" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I will therefore punish him** - Because Pilate had found no fault in Jesus he should have released him without punishment. It is not necessary to try to make this statement fit logically into the translation. Pilate punished Jesus, whom he knew to be innocent, only because he was afraid of the crowd.
