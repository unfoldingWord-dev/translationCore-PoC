\v 26 But you should not be like them! Instead, those who \add want God to\add* \add consider them\add* the greatest should \add act as though they\add* were the youngest, \add since the youngest are expected to serve the older ones\add*. Whoever is a leader should be one who serves \add the others\add*.
\v 27 Keep in mind who is the most important one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. It is certainly the one who \add just sits\add* at the table, not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* those who serve \add the meal\add*. But I, \add your leader\add*, have been \add an example for you\add* by serving you \add while I have been\add* among you.

\v 26 But you should not be like those rulers! Instead, the most honored persons among you should act as if they were the youngest, and the one who leads must act like a servant.
\v 27 For you know that the  important person is the one who eats at the table, not the servant who brings the food. But I am your servant.

\v 26 But it must not be like this with you. Instead, let the one who is the greatest among you become like the youngest. And let the one who is the most important become like the one who serves.
\v 27 For which is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as one who serves.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues teaching his apostles.

  * **it must not be like this with you** - "you should not act like that"
  * **the youngest** - As leaders were most often older people and called "elders," "the youngest" would be the least likely to lead. AT: "the least important." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For** - This connects Jesus' commands in verse 26 with the whole of verse 27. It means that the most important person should serve because Jesus is a servant.
  * **the one who serves** - "a servant"
  * **which is greater...serves?** - "who is more important...serves?" Jesus uses a question to introduce his answer to the apostles' question about greatness. AT: "I want you to think about who is greater...serves." ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the one who sits at the table** - "the one who is dining"
  * **the one who serves** - "the one who serves the food" or "the one who serves the one who sits." This refers to a servant.
  * **Is it not the one who sits at the table?** - Jesus uses another question to teach the disciples. AT: "Of course the one who sits at the table is more important than the servant!" ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Yet I am among you as one who serves** - "Yet I am serving you." The word "yet" is here because there is a contrast between what people would expect Jesus to be like and what he really was like.
