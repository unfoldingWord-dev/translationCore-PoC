===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the rooster will not crow this day, before you deny three times that you know me** - The order of the parts of the verse can be reversed: "You will deny three times that you know me before the rooster crows this day"
  * **the rooster will not crow this day, before you deny** - This can be stated positively: "the rooster will crow this day only after you deny." 
  * **the rooster will not crow** - Here, the crowing of the rooster refers to a certain time of day. Roosters often crow before the sun appears in the morning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **this day** - The Jewish day begins at sunset. Jesus was speaking after the sun had set. The rooster would crow just before morning. The morning was part of "this day." AT: "tonight" or "in the morning."
