  * **coming in a cloud** - AT: "coming down in a cloud"
  * **with power and great glory** - Here "power" probably refers to his authority to judge the world. Here "glory" may refer to a bright light. God sometimes shows his greatness with a very bright light. AT: "powerfully and gloriously" or "and he will be powerful and very glorious."
