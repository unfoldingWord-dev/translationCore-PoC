== "For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,'" ==
Jesus teaches that before he returns, many people will falsely claim to be him returning. It will also be a time of great persecution. 

== "Until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled" ==
The Jews referred to the time between the Babylonian exile and the coming of the Messiah to be king as a period of Gentile domination. This is because the Jews were not sovereign over their own affairs. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
The prophesy in this chapter contain [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphorical langauge]]. It is best to translate these events as literal unless necessary according to by the context. For example, the Phrases "torn down," "will rise against" and "not a hair on your head will perish" are metaphors. Signs in the sky, earthquakes and wars should be translated without symbolism given to them.

== Son of Man ==

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man." Every language may not have the ability to have a person refer to himself in the third person.
