  * [[:en:obe:kt:death]]

  * [[:en:obe:kt:soul]]
 
===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you will be delivered up also by parents, brothers, relatives and friends** - AT: "your parents, brothers, relatives, and friends will hand you over to the authorities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they will put some of you to death** - "they will kill some of you." Possible meanings are 1) "the authorities will kill some of you" or 2) "those who deliver you up will kill some of you." The first meaning is more likely. 
  * **because of my name** - AT: "because of me" or "because you follow me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **But not a hair of your head will perish** - This refers to one of the smallest parts of a person to emphasize that the whole person will not perish. Jesus had already said that some of them would be put to death. So some understand this to mean that they would not be harmed spiritually. AT: "But these things cannot really harm you" or "Even every hair on your head will be safe." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **In your endurance** - "By holding firm." AT: "If you do not quit."
  * **you will gain your souls** - "you will receive life" or "you will live forever"
