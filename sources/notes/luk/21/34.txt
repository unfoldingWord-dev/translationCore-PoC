\v 34 "Be very careful to control yourselves. Do not go to parties where people are acting immorally, or getting drunk. And do not carry the cares of this life with you. If you live this way, you will stop waiting for me to return. And then, at that moment, I will surprise you when I come. I will come so suddenly it will be like when a animal trap springs closed without warning.
\v 35 Indeed, I will return without warning, and that day will come when you are not ready to see me.
