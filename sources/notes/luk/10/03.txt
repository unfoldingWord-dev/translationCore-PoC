===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Go on your way** - "Go to the cities" or "Go to the people"
  * **I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves** - This means that there are people who could harm those that Jesus is sending out. The names of other animals could be substituted. AT: "When I send you out, people will want to harm you as wolves attack sheep." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **wolves** - This can be translated with a generic term like "wild dogs" or "fierce dogs" or with the name of a specific animal like a dog that your people know of, such as "coyotes" or "jackals." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **Carry no bag of money** - "Do not take a bag of money with you"
  * **greet no one on the way** - Jesus was emphasizing that they go quickly to the towns and do this work. He was not telling them to be rude.
