===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - When Jesus leaves the house, he calls Levi, the Jewish tax collector, to follow him. Levi prepares a big meal for Jesus which annoys the Pharisees and scribes.
  * **After these things happened** - The phrase "these things" refers to what happened in the previous verses. This signals a new event. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent|Introduction of a New Event]])
  * **saw a tax collector** - "looked at a tax collector with attention" or "looked carefully at a tax collector"
  * **tax collecting place** - "tax booth" or "tax-collecting station." This was a table at the side of the road where people had to pay taxes to the government.
  * **Follow me** - To "follow" someone was a term that means to become their disciple. AT: "Be my disciple" or "Come, follow me as your teacher." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **left everything** - "left his work as a tax collector"
