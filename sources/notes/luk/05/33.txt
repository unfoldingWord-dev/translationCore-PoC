\v 33 Those Jewish leaders said to Jesus, "The disciples of John the Baptizer often abstain from food and pray, and the disciples of the Pharisees do that, too. But your disciples keep on eating and drinking! Why do they not fast like the others?"
\v 34 Jesus answered, You do not tell the friends of the bridegroom to fast while he is still with them, do you? No, no one would do that!
\v 35 But some day the bridegroom will be taken away  from his friends. Then, at that time, they will abstain from food."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They said to him** - "The religious leaders said to Jesus"
  * **Can anyone make...with them?** - Jesus used this question to cause the people to think about a situation that they already know. This was be written as a statement. AT: "No one tells the wedding attendants of the bridegroom to fast while he is still with them." (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **wedding attendants** - "guests" or "friends." These are friends who celebrate with a man who is getting married.
  * **the wedding attendants of the bridegroom fast** - Fasting is a sign of sadness. The religious leaders understood that the wedding attendants would not fast while the bridegroom was with them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the days will come when** - "soon" or "some day" (UDB)
  * **the bridegroom will be taken away from them** - Jesus is comparing himself to the bridegroom, and the disciples to the wedding attendants. He did not explain the metaphor, so the translation should explain it only when necessary. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
