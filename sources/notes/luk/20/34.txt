\v 34 Jesus said to them, "The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage.
\v 35 But they who are judged to be worthy to receive the resurrection from the dead and to enter eternity neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
\v 36 Neither can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to answer the Sadducees.

  * **The sons of this world** - "The people of this world" or "The people of this time." This is in contrast with those in heaven or the people who live after the resurrection.
  * **marry, and are given in marriage** - In that culture they spoke of men marrying women and women being given in marriage to their husband. AT: "get married." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they who are judged to be worthy** - AT: "the people whom God has considered to be worthy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to receive the resurrection from the dead** - "to be raised from the dead" or "to rise from the dead"
  * **neither marry, nor are given in marriage** - "will not get married." This is after the resurrection.
  * **Neither can they die anymore** - This is after the resurrection. AT: "They will not be able to die anymore." 
  * **and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection** - AT: "are children of God because he has brought them back from the dead"
