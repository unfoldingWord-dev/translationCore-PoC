====== Luke 20 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 20:17, 42-43, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Trap ==
This chapter contains two traps or questions designed to catch someone admitting something they do not wish to say. Jesus asks a question of the Pharisees that traps them by forcing them to either admit they believe John the Baptist was a [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophet]] or anger the Jews by denying this. The leaders tried to trap Jesus by asking him about paying taxes to the Roman government. Answering yes would anger the Jews and answering no would anger the Romans. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Paradox ==

This is a statement that seems absurd or appears to contradict itself. In this chapter, Jesus quotes a psalm referencing that David calls his son "lord," that is, master. The Jews always expected that ancestors would be greater than their descendants. In this passage, Jesus is trying to gradually lead his hearers to the true understanding that the Messiah will himself be divine, and that he, Jesus, is in fact the Messiah.
