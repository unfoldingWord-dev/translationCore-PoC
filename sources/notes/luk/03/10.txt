===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - John begins to respond to questions that people in the crowd ask him.

  * **asked him, saying** - "asked him and said" or "asked John"
  * **answered and said to them** - "answered them, saying" or "answered them" or "said"
  * **do likewise** - "do the same thing." This refers back to giving food to those in need. It may be helpful to state this. AT: "give food to someone who does not have any." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
