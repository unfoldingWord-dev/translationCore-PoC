===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins his ministry with his baptism.

  * **Now it came about** - This phrase marks the beginning of a new event in the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **while all the people were being baptized by John** - "while John was baptizing all the people." The phrase "all the people" refers to the people present with John. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **baptized by John** - Some audiences might be confused that John was baptizing when Herod put him in prison in the previous verse. If so, it might be helpful to tell them that this account happened before John was arrested. The UDB does this by putting "But before John was put in prison" at the beginning of this verse.
  * **Jesus also was baptized** - AT: "John baptized Jesus, too" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the heavens opened up** - "the sky opened" or "the sky became open." This is more than a simple clearing of clouds, but it's not clear what it means. It possibly means that a hole appeared in the sky.
  * **The Holy Spirit came down on him** - "The Holy Spirit came down onto Jesus"
  * **in bodily form like a dove** - "in physical form looking like a dove"
  * **You are my beloved Son** - God the Father speaks to his "beloved Son" Jesus, God the Son, while God the Spirit descends upon Jesus. The persons of God love one another and work together as Father, Son, and Spirit.
  * **my beloved Son** - This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
