\v 49 John replied to Jesus, "Master, we saw a man who was using your name to command demons to come out of people. So we told him to stop doing that, because he is not following you as part of our group."
\v 50 But Jesus said, "Do not stop him from doing that! If someone is not doing something that is harmful to you, then what he is doing is helpful to you!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **John answered and said** - John was responding to what Jesus had said about being the greatest. He was not answering a question. He wanted to know what rank this man who was forcing out demons would have among the disciples. AT: "In reply, John said" or "John replied to Jesus." 
  * **Master** - The word that is translated here as "master" is a not the normal word for "master." Here it refers to someone who has authority, and not to someone who owns someone else. AT: "Boss" or "Sir."
  * **in your name** - This means the person was speaking with the power and authority of Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Do not stop him** - AT: "Allow him to continue"
  * **he that is not against you is for you** - Some modern languages have sayings that mean the same thing. AT: "if a person does not hinder you, it is as if they were helping you" or "if someone is not working contrary to you, he is working in your favor."
