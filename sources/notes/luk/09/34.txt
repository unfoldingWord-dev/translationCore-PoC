\v 34 Then while he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they were surrounded by the cloud.
\v 35 A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my chosen Son. Listen to him."
\v 36 When the voice had finished, Jesus was alone. They kept silent, and in those days they told no one any of the things which they had seen.
