===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to talk with the people along the road.

  * **Follow me** - This implies to be Jesus' disciple and go with him.
  * **allow me first to go** - "before I do that, let me go."
  * **Leave the dead to bury their own dead** - Since people who are dead cannot bury anyone, the implied meaning here is to let the spiritually dead people bury the physically dead people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
