====== Luke 12 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Blasphemy against the Spirit" ==

There is a great deal of controversy regarding properly identifying this specific [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]]. However, it seems to involve insulting the Holy Spirit and his work. Since part of his work is to convince people that they are sinners and that they need God's forgiveness, anyone who mocked this truth would be unwilling to come in repentance to God. For this reason, he would not be forgiven.

== Stewardship ==
Although this word is not used in this chapter, it is a concept which plays a significant part of the teaching of this chapter. Stewardship is being trustworthy in the handling of the things which have been entrusted to you. God expects each person to use the gifts that he has given to them. This includes not only the natural gifts or abilities that God has given to man, but the quality of a person's life especially related to living with the guarantee of eternal life. God also expects people to live in the expectation of the imminent return of Jesus.

== Division ==
There is an important teaching about division in this chapter ([[:en:bible:notes:luk:12:51|12:51-56]]). This division is not intended to imply that people will become enemies. Instead, it references that there is now a clear division in the world between those who are Christians and those who are not. One's identity as a follower of Jesus, is more significant than any family relation.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "There is nothing concealed, that will not be revealed" ==
There are some teachings that have implicit knowledge associated with them. This phrase and others concern a future time of judgement ([[:en:bible:notes:luk:12:02|12:2-5]]). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Son of man" ==
Jesus refers to himself as the [[:en:obe:kt:sonofman|Son of Man]]. Some languages may struggle having a person refer to himself in the third person.

== General and Specific Instructions ==
There are times that the New Testament gives specific instructions or commands that always applies to all Christians. At other times, its instructions are more general instructions and should only be taken as "good ideas." For example, "do not be anxious" or "sell your possessions" are not meant to be instructive to all Christians.
