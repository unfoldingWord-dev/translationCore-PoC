\v 13 Then one of the people in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide my father's property with me!"
\v 14 But Jesus replied to him, "Man, no one made me a judge to settle arguments that people have about property!"
\v 15 Then he said to the whole crowd, "Be careful not to be greedy in any way! The value of a man's life is not determined by how many things he owns."

\v 13 Then someone from the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
\v 14 Jesus said to him, "Man, who made me a judge or a mediator over you?"
\v 15 And he said to them, "Watch that you keep yourselves from all greedy desires, because a person's life does not consist of the abundance of his possessions."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is a break in Jesus' teachings. A man asks Jesus to do something and Jesus responds to him.
  * **Man** - Possible meanings are 1) this is simply a way to address a stranger or 2) Jesus is rebuking the man. Your language might have a way of addressing people in either of these ways. Some people do not translate this word at all.
  * **who made me a judge or a mediator over you?** - Jesus uses a question to teach the man. AT: "I am not your judge or mediator." Some languages would use the plural form for "you" or "your." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of You]])
  * **And he said to them** - The word "them" here probably refers to the whole crowd of people. AT: "And Jesus said to the crowd."
  * **keep yourselves from all greedy desires** - "guard yourself from every form of greed." AT: "do not allow yourself to love having things" or "do not let the urge to have more things control you."
  * **a person's life** - This is a general statement of fact. It does not refer to any specific person. Some languages have a way of expressing that.
  * **the abundance of his possessions** - "how many things he owns" (UDB) or "how much wealth he has"
