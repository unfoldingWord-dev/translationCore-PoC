<usfm>
\v 41 None of you should be concerned about someone else's small faults. That is like noticing a speck of straw in that person's eye while not noticing a huge wooden plank in your own eye.
\v 42 If you do that, you are a hypocrite! You should first remove the plank out of your own eye before trying to get the speck out of someone else's eye. When you have stopped sinning, then you will have the spiritual insight to help others get rid of their sins.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 41 And why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
\v 42 How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not even see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brother's eye.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **why do you look...but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?** - Jesus uses this question to challenge the people to pay attention to their own sins before they pay attention to another person's sins. AT: "do not look...but ignore the log that is in your own eye." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye** - This is a metaphor that refers to the less important faults of a fellow believer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **tiny piece of straw** - "speck" (UDB) or "splinter" or "bit of dust." Use a word for the smallest thing that commonly falls into a person's eyes. 
  * **brother** - Here "brother" refers to a fellow Jew or a fellow believer in Jesus.
  * **the log that is in your own eye** - This is a metaphor for a person's most important faults. A log could not literally go into a person's eye. Jesus is emphasizing that a person should pay attention to his own more important faults before he deals with another person's less important faults. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **log** - "beam" or "plank"
  * **How can you say...eye?** - Jesus asks this question to challenge the people to pay attention to their own sins before they pay attention to another person's sins. AT: "You should not say...eye." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
