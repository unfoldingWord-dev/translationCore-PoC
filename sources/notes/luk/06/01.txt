===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus and his disciples now walk through a grain field while some Pharisees begin to question the disciples about what they are doing on a Saturday which, in God's law, has been set aside for God.
  * **General Information:** - The word "you" here is plural, and refers to the disciples. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **Now it happened** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **grain fields** - In this case, these are large sections of land where the people had scattered wheat seed to grow more wheat.
  * **heads of grain** - This is the topmost part of the grain plant, which is a kind of large grass. It holds the mature, edible seeds of the plant.
  * **rubbing them between their hands** - They did this to separate the grain seeds. This could be stated clearly. AT: "They rubbed them in their hands to separate the grains from the husks" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Why are you doing something that is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?** - They asked this question to accuse the disciples of breaking the law. It could be written as a statement. AT: "Picking grain on the Sabbath is against God's law!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **doing something** - The Pharisees considered even the small action of rubbing a handful of grain to be unlawful work. This could be stated clearly. AT: "doing work" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
