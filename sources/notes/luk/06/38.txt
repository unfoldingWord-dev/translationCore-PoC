===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 38 Give good things to others, and then God will give good things to you. It will be like he is giving you a generous amount of grain, pressing it down in a basket and shaking the basket to make sure it is completely full, to the point that some of the grain even spills over the sides! Remember that the standard you use to judge or bless others will be the standard God uses to judge or bless you!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 38 Give to others, and it will be given to you. A generous amount—pressed down, shaken together and spilling over—they will pour into your lap. For with whatever standard of measure you use to measure with, that same standard will be used to measure for you."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **it will be given to you** - Jesus did not say exactly who would give. Possible meanings are 1) "someone will give it to you" or 2) "God will give it to you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **A generous amount...your lap** - The order of this sentence can be reversed. AT: "They will pour into your lap a generous amount that they have pressed down and shaken together until it is spilling over." Jesus used the metaphor of a grain merchant giving a generous amount. AT: "Like a grain merchant who presses down the grain and shakes it together and pours in so much grain that it spills over, they will give generously to you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **A generous amount** - "A large amount"
  * **that same standard will be used to measure for you** - Jesus did not say exactly who would measure. Possible meanings are 1) "they will measure things for you by that same standard" or 2) "God will use that same standard to measure for you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
