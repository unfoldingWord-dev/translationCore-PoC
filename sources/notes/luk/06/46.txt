<usfm>
\v 46 Jesus said to the people, "Why do you call me 'Lord' when you do not even obey what I say to do?
\v 47 Let me tell you what people are like who come to me, hear my teachings, and obey them.
\v 48 They are like a man who dug deep into the ground to prepare to build his house. He made sure that the foundation for the house was built on solid rock. Then there was a flood and a torrent of water was beating against the house. But the torrent could not even shake the house, because the house was built on a solid foundation.

\v 46 Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and yet you do not obey the things that I say?
\v 47 Every person who comes to me and hears my words and obeys them, I will tell you what he is like.
\v 48 He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep in the ground and built the house's foundation on solid rock. When a flood came, the torrent of water flowed against that house, but could not shake it, because it had been well built.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **General Statement:** - Jesus compares the person who obeys his teaching to a man who builds a house on rock where it will be safe from floods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])

  * **Lord, Lord** - The repetition of these words indicates that they regularly called Jesus "Lord."
  * **Every person who comes to me...I will tell you what he is like. ** - It may be more clear to change the order of this sentence. AT: "I will tell you what every person is like who comes to me and hears my words and obeys them."
  * **built the house's foundation on solid rock** - "dug the foundation of the house deep enough to reach a foundation of solid rock." Some cultures may not be familiar with building on bedrock, and may need to use another image for a stable foundation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **foundation** - "base" or "support"
  * **solid rock** - "bedrock." This is the very large, hard rock that is deep under the soil.
  * **torrent of water** - "fast-moving water" or "river"
  * **flowed against** - "crashed against"
  * **could not shake it** - Possible meanings are 1) "cause it to shake" or 2) "destroy it."
  * **because it had been well built** - "because the man had built it well" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
