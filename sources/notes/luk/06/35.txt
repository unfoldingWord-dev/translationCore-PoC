\v 35 Instead, love your enemies! Do good things for them! Lend to them, and do not expect them to pay anything back! Then God will give you a great reward. And you will be children of God the Most High, since God is kind even to people who are unthankful and wicked.
\v 36 So you should act mercifully toward other people, just like your Father in heaven acts mercifully toward people.

<usfm>
\v 35 But love your enemies and do them good. Lend to them, never worrying about getting anything back, and your reward will be great. You will be sons of the Most High, for he himself is kind toward unthankful and evil people.
\v 36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **your reward will be great** - "you will receive a great reward" or "you will receive good payment" or "you will get good gifts because of it"
  * **You will be sons of the Most High** - It is best to translate "sons with the same word your language would naturally use to refer to a human son or child.
  * **sons of the Most High** - Make sure that the word "sons" is plural so it is not confused with Jesus' title "The Son of the Most High."
  * **unthankful and evil people** - "people who who do not thank him and who are evil"
  * **your Father** - This refers to God. It is best to translate "Father" with the same word your language would naturally use to refer to a human father.
