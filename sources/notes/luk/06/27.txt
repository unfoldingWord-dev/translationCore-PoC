===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to speak to his disciples and the crowd who is listening to him as well.

  * **to you who are listening** - Jesus now begins to speak to the entire crowd, rather than just to his disciples. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **love...do good...Bless...pray** - Each of these commands are to be done continually, not just a single time.
  * **love your enemies** - This does not mean they were to only love their enemies and not their friends. This can be stated. AT: "Love your enemies, not only your friends!" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **love...do good to** - These two phrases mean the same thing, and together emphasize the point. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Bless those** - God is the one who blesses. This idiom could be rewritten. AT: "Ask God to bless those" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **those who curse you** - "those who habitually curse you"
  * **those who mistreat you** - "those who habitually mistreat you"
