\v 6 Another Sabbath\f + \ft Or: Jewish day of rest \f* Jesus entered a synagogue\f + \ft Or: Jewish meeting place \f* and taught the people. There was a man there whose right hand was shriveled.
\v 7 The men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws and the Pharisees \add who were there\add* watched Jesus, to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*. They did this so that, \add if he healed the man\add*, they would accuse him \add of disobeying their laws by working on the day of rest\add*.
\v 8 But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Come and stand here \add in front of everyone\add*!" So the man got up and stood there.

\v 6 It happened on another Sabbath that he went into the synagogue and taught the people there. A man was there whose right hand was shriveled.
\v 7 The scribes and the Pharisees were watching him closely to see whether he would heal someone on the Sabbath, so that they might find a reason to accuse him of doing something wrong.
\v 8 But he knew what they were thinking and he said to the man whose hand was shriveled, "Get up, and stand here in the middle of everyone." So the man got up and stood there.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The scribes and Pharisees watch as Jesus heals a man on Saturday.
  * **General Information:** - It is now another Sabbath day and Jesus is in the synagogue.

  * **It happened** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new event in the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **A man was there** - This introduces a new character in the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **hand was shriveled** - The man's hand was damaged in such a way that he could not stretch it. It was probably bent into almost a fist, making it look smaller and wrinkled.
  * **were watching him closely** - "were watching Jesus carefully"
  * **so that they might find** - AT: "because they wanted to find"
  * **doing something wrong** - The Jewish leaders incorrectly considered almost any action on the Sabbath to be "work." This could be stated. AT: "disobeying their laws about not working on the Sabbath" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in the middle of everyone** - "in front of everyone" (UDB). Jesus wanted the man to stand where everyone there could see him.
