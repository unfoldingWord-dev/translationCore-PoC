\v 13 Before he left, he summoned ten of his servants. He gave each of them an equal amount of money. He said to them, 'Do business with this money until I return!' Then he left.
\v 14 But many people of his country hated him. So they sent some messengers to follow him and say to the higher king, 'We do not want this man to be our king!'
\v 15 But he was made king anyway. Later he returned as the new king. Then he called in the servants to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much they had gained by doing business with the money he had given them.

\v 13 He called ten of his servants, and gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Conduct business until I come back.'
\v 14 But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation of ambassadors after him, saying, 'We will not have this man rule over us.'
\v 15 It happened when he came back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded the servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what profit they had made by doing business.
