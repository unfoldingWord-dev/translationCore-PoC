<usfm>
\v 3 He tried to see Jesus, but he was very short and there was a big crowd of people \add near Jesus\add*. So he was not able to see him.
\v 4 So he ran further ahead \add along the road\add* that Jesus was walking on. He climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see Jesus.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 He wanted to see Jesus but he could not see him over the crowd. He was a very short man and there were many people around Jesus.
\v 4 So he ran further down the road. He climbed a sycamore fig tree so he could see Jesus when he came by.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not see over the crowd, because he was small in height.
\v 4 So he ran on ahead of the people and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was about to pass that way.
