translationCore
=====
This project's goal is to provide in depth checking tools for Bible translation.
Instead of just checking verse by verse with many things to consider at once, it is checking one type at a time, going through the whole bibleâ€¦ a pivot on the checking process.

This will provide quantifiable and measurable quality of the translation output.

All of the checking tools are extracted from the translation notes that are made for each verse to ensure that the information is available to the translators while translating.

translationCore Proof of Concept
-----
Focused Proof of Concept of translationCore to be produced just for Metaphors & Ephesians.
